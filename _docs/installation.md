## Requirements

To run Meta Box, we recommend:
- PHP 7.2 or greater
- Latest version of WordPress

While Meta Box also works with PHP 5.2 and older versions of WordPress, these versions have reached official End Of Life and as such may expose your site to security vulnerabilities.

## Installing Meta Box

The Meta Box plugin is [available on wordpress.org](https://wordpress.org/plugins/meta-box/). To install it, go to **Plugins &rarr; Add New** and search for **Meta Box**.
