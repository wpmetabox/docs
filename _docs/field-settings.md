title: Field settings
---

Each field contains settings to determine where and how data is loaded and saved. All fields share some common settings, but also offer unique settings per field type. These unique settings can be found by reading more about the field type.

Field settings can be customized when editing a field group in Meta Box Builder or the `fields` array if you use code to create a field group. In Meta Box Builder, settings are put into 2 tabs: General and Advanced.

Below are the screenshots of text field settings:

## Common settings

Each field setting in the Meta Box Builder has a proper label and tooltip (if necessary) to explain what it is. Below is the table of common settings for all fields with the corresponding setting ID in case you use code.

### General

These are common field settings in the General tab in Meta Box Builder.

## Default value

The mechanism of `std` in Meta Box works only if the **field group has not been saved before**. It means all fields in that field group, not just the specific field that you set the `std` for. So if there's any field that already has value, then `std` won't work for other fields, even new fields you've just added.

Examples:

When you create a new post, then no fields have values (of course), then `std` works for all fields.

When you edit an existing post that has a field group, then some fields might have values. Therefore, `std` doesn't work for all fields. In this case, if you edit the field group and add a new field, `std` still doesn't work for that new field (even it has no value before), because the field group has been saved before.

## Field-specific settings

Besides all common settings, each field type can have its own settings. Please see more details for each field type on the left menu (section "Fields").

{% include alert.html content="To save time read and write settings for fields, we've already prepared some code examples that you can get from [Meta Box Code Snippet Library](https://github.com/wpmetabox/library/)." %}

## Customize field settings

Outside of the "Edit field group" UI, it is possible to modify a field's settings via the [rwmb_normalize_field](https://docs.metabox.io/filters/#rwmb_normalize_field) filter. This filter exposes the `$field` settings array for each field and allows customization to all settings.

This example shows how to modify a specific field (called `customer_name`) via this filter to customize settings unavailable to the UI.

```php
add_filter( 'rwmb_normalize_customer_name_field', function( $field ) {
	$field['required'] = true;
	$field['size'] = 20;
	$field['placeholder'] = 'Mark Cuban';

	return $field;
} );

```
