title: Creating a post type
---

WordPress houses lots of different types of content and they are divided into something called **post typesï»¿**. Whilst there are already some built-in post types within WordPress (such as post, page, or attachment), you may want to create custom post types if you want to break things down into smaller categories. For example, if you want to have a section on Books or Events, it would be better suited to creating a custom post type for them.

Creating a custom post type is done by either of the following methods:

- **Using MB Custom Post Types & Custom Taxonomies**. This extension is already bundled in Meta Box AIO/MB Core, or you can install it for free from [WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/plugins/mb-custom-post-type/).
- **Using our Post Type Generator**.
- **Using code** with the `register_post_type()` function.

This documentation shows you how to create post types with **MB Custom Post Types & Custom Taxonomies** extension, as it's the best way. To use the Post Type Generator, please follow [this guide](/post-type-generator/). To use the `register_post_type()`, please see [WordPress documentation](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/register_post_type/).

Here is a video tutorial on creating custom post types and custom taxonomies with MB Custom Post Types & Custom Taxonomies extension (text version below):

To create a new custom post type, go to **Meta Box &rarr; Post Types** and click **Add New**:

The settings are divided into 5 tabs (explained in details below):

- **General**: the post type names and slug
- **Labels**: all labels for the post type
- **Advanced**: advanced settings for the post types, including menu position, menu icon, REST API support, rewrite rules, etc.
- **Supports**: the features that the post type supports
- **Taxonomies**: the taxonomies that connect to the post type

After done, click the **Publish** button to register the post type. Or click the **Get PHP Code** button to get the PHP code that you can insert into your theme's `functions.php` file (or your plugin's file). After inserting, you can deactivate the extension to make your site a little bit faster.
