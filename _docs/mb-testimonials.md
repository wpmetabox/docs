## Overview

MB Testimonials is a WordPress plugin that helps you add testimonials to your website easily. It has **7 beautiful pre-made** templates that you can customize with HTML / CSS. In addition, you can display the testimonials in two styles: grid and slider.

**Note**: MB Testimonials plugin is only available for the [Lifetime Bundle](https://metabox.io/pricing/).

## Installation

**Note**: MB Testimonials and [other solutions](https://metabox.io/product-category/solutions/) are not included in Meta Box AIO, so you can install them independently without Meta Box AIO.
