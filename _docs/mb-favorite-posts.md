## Overview

**MB Favorite Posts** is a WordPress plugin that helps you create the “Favorite Post” button easily. Users can click the button to **bookmark posts as favorites**, and then review them on a Dashboard page. You can enable this feature for **both guests and logged-in users**.

**Note**: MB Favorite Posts plugin is only available for the [Lifetime Bundle](https://metabox.io/pricing/).

For more information, please see the [solution page](https://metabox.io/plugins/mb-favorite-posts/).

## Installation

First, you need to install and activate the Meta Box plugin from [wordpress.org](https://wordpress.org/plugins/meta-box/). Next, download MB Favorite Posts plugin from the [My Account](https://metabox.io/my-account/) page, then upload the <code>.zip</code> file from the **Admin Dashboard**. MB Favorite Posts and [other solutions](https://metabox.io/product-category/solutions/) are not included in Meta Box AIO, so you can install them independently without Meta Box AIO.

Upon finishing, the Favorite Posts Button will be automatically added to your WordPress website with the default settings:

To configure the Favorite Posts button to fit your needs, move to the next step.

### Enable for non-logged in users

When you enable this feature, users don’t have to log in to add the post to their favorite list.

If you don’t enable this feature, the following message will show up when users click the favorite post button:

You can also **disable the Favorite Posts button** by unticking all post types in this section.

### Dashboard Page and Register Page

MB Favorite Posts are integrated with [MB User Profile](https://metabox.io/plugins/mb-user-profile/) to help users create the Dashboard page and the Register page automatically without coding.

The Dashboard page shows all the favorite posts of a user, and the Register page contains a form that users can sign up for accounts to use the Favorite Posts feature.

**Note**: when a user signs up for an account on the Register Page, his user role will be **Subscriber**.

You can choose available pages on the website and change them to the Dashboard page and the Register page.

For example, I choose these pages:

![Change two pages to the Dashboard page and the Register page](https://i.imgur.com/6e5wOLu.png)

Better yet, you should create brand new pages for this purpose. To do so, go to **Pages** > **Add New**, fill in the name for the page and click **Publish**.

The Register page and the Dashboard page will be displayed on the front end as follows:
