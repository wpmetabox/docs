title: Meta Box Overview
---

Meta Box is a framework that helps developers build custom meta boxes and custom fields in WordPress fast and easily. It has a wide range of field types, field settings and supports not only posts but also terms, users, comments, settings pages, and custom tables.

Meta Box has 3 parts:

- **Meta Box core plugin**, which is free and available on [wordpress.org](https://wordpress.org/plugins/meta-box/). It's the foundation of all features and is always required (activated).
- **Extensions**: provide extra features (free or premium). Extensions are like modules and can be used separately. All extensions are bundled into a special plugin Meta Box AIO/MB Core, which allows you to install only one plugin and have all features. You can enable/disable extensions in Meta Box AIO/MB Core if you want.
- **Solutions**: ready-to-use plugins for real use cases. They contain needed extensions for specific purposes and custom code to make them do the task.
